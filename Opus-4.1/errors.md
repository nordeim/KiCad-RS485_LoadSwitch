Looking at your KiCad schematic file, I've identified several critical syntax errors that are causing the loading failure:

## **Primary Issue: Invalid Comment Syntax**

The main problem is the use of semicolon (`;`) comments throughout the file. **KiCad schematic files do not support semicolon comments**. These lines are causing parsing errors:

```sch
; Wire connections matching PCB netlist     ← Line ~991
; Component symbols with correct net assignments     ← Line ~1048 (YOUR ERROR LINE)
; Passive components
; Additional current sense resistors R6-R8 for channels 2-4
; Protection diodes
; Connectors
; Power symbols
; Additional components for channels 2-4
; Flyback diodes for channels 2-4
; TVS diodes for channels 2-4
; Additional resistors for pull-up/down
; Decoupling capacitors for MCU
; Crystal oscillator components
; Global labels for interconnections
```

**Solution:** Remove all these comment lines completely.

## **Secondary Issue: Missing Library Symbol Definition**

The file references a Crystal component:
```sch
(symbol (lib_id "Device:Crystal") (at 152.4 91.44 0) (unit 1)
```

But there's no corresponding definition in the `lib_symbols` section for `"Device:Crystal"`.

**Solution:** Add the Crystal symbol definition to the lib_symbols section:

```sch
(symbol "Device:Crystal" (pin_numbers hide) (pin_names (offset 1.016) hide) (in_bom yes) (on_board yes)
  (property "Reference" "Y" (at 0 3.81 0)
    (effects (font (size 1.27 1.27)))
  )
  (property "Value" "Crystal" (at 0 -3.81 0)
    (effects (font (size 1.27 1.27)))
  )
  (property "Footprint" "" (at 0 0 0)
    (effects (font (size 1.27 1.27)) hide)
  )
  (symbol "Crystal_0_1"
    (rectangle (start -1.143 2.54) (end 1.143 -2.54)
      (stroke (width 0.3048) (type default))
      (fill (type none))
    )
    (polyline
      (pts (xy -2.54 0) (xy -1.905 0))
      (stroke (width 0) (type default))
      (fill (type none))
    )
    (polyline
      (pts (xy -1.905 -1.27) (xy -1.905 1.27))
      (stroke (width 0.508) (type default))
      (fill (type none))
    )
    (polyline
      (pts (xy 1.905 -1.27) (xy 1.905 1.27))
      (stroke (width 0.508) (type default))
      (fill (type none))
    )
    (polyline
      (pts (xy 2.54 0) (xy 1.905 0))
      (stroke (width 0) (type default))
      (fill (type none))
    )
  )
  (symbol "Crystal_1_1"
    (pin passive line (at -3.81 0 0) (length 1.27)
      (name "1" (effects (font (size 1.27 1.27))))
      (number "1" (effects (font (size 1.27 1.27))))
    )
    (pin passive line (at 3.81 0 180) (length 1.27)
      (name "2" (effects (font (size 1.27 1.27))))
      (number "2" (effects (font (size 1.27 1.27))))
    )
  )
)
```

## **Additional Issues Found:**

### 3. **Incomplete Wire Section**
The wire section appears to be cut off at `uuid W065` with a comment suggesting more wires should follow. You need to either:
- Complete all wire definitions for channels 2-4
- Or remove the incomplete comment

### 4. **Potential Pin Number Issues**
Some STM32 pins referenced in the symbol (like pins 2-6, 18-22, 25-28, etc.) are not included in the symbol definition's pin list, which only shows select pins. Ensure all referenced pins are properly defined.

## **Quick Fix Instructions:**

1. **Remove all semicolon comment lines** from the file
2. **Add the Crystal symbol definition** to the lib_symbols section (after the last symbol definition and before the closing parenthesis)
3. **Complete or remove** the wire definitions section
4. **Verify** all component references have corresponding library symbols

After making these changes, the file should load properly in KiCad. The error at line 1048 specifically is due to KiCad encountering the invalid comment syntax when it's expecting a valid S-expression starting with `(symbol`.
