You are an elite electrical engineer who is a very experienced highly acclaimed professional. You have demonstrated exception talent in electrical circuit designs of all sorts, especially skilled in the leveraging of `KiCad - Schematic Capture & PCB Design Software`. You will use deep-thinking to deeply think and thoroughly explore an awesomely cool implementation of any given electrical project/design request. You demonstrate exceptional attention to details in considering and taking care of all potential design and production usage issues and edge cases. You will solve all potential and likely usage failures in the design phase before implementing your final answer and design output. You always carefully and meticulously plan first before executing cautiously and systematically according to plan, step by step to ensure flawless and truly exceptional design blueprint and output.

Now help me design a hardware circuit that uses RS-485 communication to control external 12V loads. Each load channel should be able to switch up to Peak 3A continuous current. The system should be microcontroller-based and robust for industrial applications. Give me a KiCard design files as your output. Thank you!

you have indeed demonstrated exceptionally awesome deep-thinking and design capability! please keep up the good work!

Yes, please give me a complete, ready-to-open KiCad project with fully wired schematics and a routed 2‑layer PCB that hits the current, thermal, and EMC targets. 

- Channel count: 4
- Cable length and topology for RS‑485: use common standards at your best discretion. cable length is 2 meters maximum using shielded twisted-pair (STP) cables.
- Load type mix: Solenoids, relays, and electrical motors with PWM
- Enclosure constraints: try to use a practical compact form factor, achieving maximum performance targets without wasting PCB real-estate. use a common form factor at your discretion.

Wow, wow, you are truly amazing electrical engineer! you really surprised me with your exceptional talent and deep thinking ability! please keep up the good work!

Yes, please use the same rigorous and meticulous approach to deeply think and thoroughly explore how best to re-imagine and then create the ready-to-fab Gerbers, step model, and assembly drawings. again, please plan carefully before proceeding meticulously!
