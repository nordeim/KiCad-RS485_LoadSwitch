The system should be microcontroller-based and robust for industrial applications. Give me a KiCard design files as your output. Thank you!

For a robust, microcontroller-based industrial control system using RS-485 to switch 12V loads up to 3A continuous, here are the key functional blocks you should include in your hardware design:

ðŸ”§ Basic Functional Blocks Overview
1. Power Supply Block

Inputs: Typically 12V or 24V industrial supply.

Outputs:

12V (direct or regulated) for load switching.

5V or 3.3V regulated for microcontroller and logic (using buck converter or LDO).

Protection:

Reverse polarity protection.

TVS diodes for surge/transients.

Input filtering (LC or ferrite + capacitor).

2. Microcontroller Unit (MCU)

ðŸ’¡ Notes:

You can modularize the Load Switching Block to support scalable channels (e.g., 4, 8, or 16).

Place status LEDs on each load output and possibly on RS-485 TX/RX lines.

If needed, insert a configuration interface block (DIP switch or UART CLI).

Circuit that will control external loads over RS-485 communication. The loads operate at 12V, and each load channel can draw up to 1A continuous with peaks up to 3A. But I need solid, reliable switching and protection. Iâ€™m using a microcontroller to handle communication and logic. Can you help me select: A good N-channel MOSFET for switching these loads A suitable flyback/freewheeling diode A robust RS-485 transceiver IC (Hint:SN75176) A buck converter to step 12V down to 5V An LDO regulator to derive 3.3V for the MCU A microcontroller recommendation for RS-485 control.(Hint:STM32F103)
