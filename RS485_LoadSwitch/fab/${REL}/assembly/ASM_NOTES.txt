Assembly Class: IPC-A-610 Class 2, lead-free reflow
Stencil: 0.12–0.15 mm laser-cut, ENIG boards; windowpane big pads (LM2596 tab ~50% coverage)
Fiducials: Use 3 global top fiducials; local fiducials near STM32 and TC4468
Reflow: Pb-free profile; peak 245 °C max, per paste spec
Polarity:
- Diodes: Notch/band matches silkscreen bar; STPS3L60 band to +12V
- TVS: Cathode mark to +12V (outputs), SM712 ref to silk dot
- ICs: Pin-1 triangle on silk + dot on package
Hand-inserted THT:
- TO-220 (IRLZ44N, IRF4905), terminal blocks, large electrolytics
- Recommend wave or selective; clip heatsinks if used
Torque (terminal blocks): 0.22–0.25 N·m typical (per vendor datasheet)
Cleaning: No-clean flux acceptable; clean if residue causes leakage in high-impedance areas
De-populate (DNF) by default: Polyfuse, RC snubbers, CMC on RS-485 (unless specified)
