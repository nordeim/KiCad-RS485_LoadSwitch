Title: RS-485 4-Channel 12V Load Controller – Rev A
Standards: IPC-A-600/610 Class 2, RoHS (lead-free)
Board: 2-layer FR-4, Tg ≥150°C, 1.6 mm thickness, 2 oz copper (both sides)
Finish: ENIG (preferred) or LF HASL
Soldermask: Green, tent all vias except designated testpoints
Silkscreen: White, component refs and polarity must remain legible post-assembly
Min features: 6/6 mil trace/space (logic), 20/20 mil for high-current preferred
Holes: PTH min drill 0.30 mm (signal vias), NPTH tooling 2.5 mm, mounting M3 NPTH 3.5 mm
Panelization: If required, 2 x 3 array with 8–10 mm rails, mousebites or V-score per fab guidelines
Acceptability: No soldermask on pads, no silkscreen over exposed pads, no soldermask dams < 4 mil
Electrical Test: 100% netlist test required
Marking: Date code and lot code on back silkscreen area reserved
Copper balance: Add thieving if required by fab; do not alter functional copper
Stackup: Standard 2-layer, εr ~4.3, specify impedance control N/A
Notes:
- Observe creepage ≥1.2 mm on +12V switching nodes
- Mounting holes NPTH; keep 6 mm copper keepout around holes
- Keep-out around RS-485 connector for mating hardware
